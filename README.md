## Work Experience
### In Canada
- #### Assistant Dishwasher
    As an Assistant Dishwasher, I supported the kitchen team by maintaining cleanliness and organization in a fast-paced, high-volume environment. My responsibilities included washing dishes, utensils, and cookware efficiently, ensuring they met hygiene standards, and assisting in cleaning kitchen areas. Occasionally, I also peeled carrots and potatoes to help prepare ingredients and streamline kitchen prep work. This role strengthened my attention to detail, time management, and teamwork skills, as I adapted quickly to fluctuating demands and helped maintain a clean and organized workspace.

- #### Hobbyist Photographer
    Photography is a serious hobby of mine, where I continually develop my skills in DSLR photography at [Soha Studio](https://diansoha.com/). Through this experience, I’ve learned the technical aspects of photography, including camera settings, lighting techniques, and composition. I have practiced various photography styles, enhancing my ability to capture detail and convey emotion through images. This hobby has strengthened my creativity, attention to detail, and patience, all of which are invaluable in visual work.

### International Experience
- #### Independent Android Developer
    As a multidisciplinary Android developer, I bring a unique blend of scientific and technical expertise to my work. My background in Clinical Laboratory Sciences has equipped me with an analytical approach to problem-solving, a keen eye for precision, and rigorous attention to detail—qualities that are invaluable in software development. Theoretical Physics has further sharpened my abilities in logical reasoning and complex algorithmic thinking, allowing me to approach app development with a robust understanding of mathematical and physical models.  
    My greatest achievement in the IT world is [Texi](https://texi.app/), a project that took over ten years to develop.

- #### Clinical Laboratory Technologist 
    As a Clinical Laboratory Technologist, I performed essential diagnostic testing and analyses to assist in patient care and treatment decisions. My responsibilities included preparing and analyzing biological samples, such as blood, tissue, and other body fluids, using advanced laboratory equipment and methodologies. I ensured accuracy and precision in test results, closely following quality control procedures and maintaining meticulous records. This role required a strong foundation in laboratory sciences, critical thinking, and attention to detail, as well as effective communication skills to report findings to healthcare professionals. Through this position, I developed a deep understanding of clinical diagnostics, laboratory safety protocols, and patient confidentiality standards.


## Lectures
[Café Planck](https://www.cafeplanck.com/)’s Programming and Educational Lab represents over thirty years of dedication to mathematics and physics tutoring. The lab employs advanced techniques to deliver tailored solutions for science education. Interactive demonstrations and self-paced computer labs engage students, while high-end technologies provide custom support for teachers of all proficiency levels. The lab specializes in making computing solutions more accessible through dynamic scientific animations. Utilizing Wolfram technologies, it covers physics and mathematics formulas from basic to advanced levels, facilitating students in producing comprehensive theses with precise computations and visualizations.


## Animations
I have [uploaded](https://www.cafeplanck.com/video) a few examples of scientific animations I created years ago and used in my teaching. I still firmly believe that using these types of animations is one of the most effective methods for teaching science.


## Awards
I had the honor of receiving the [Medal of Honor for Foreign Affairs](http://www.france-phaleristique.com/medaille_honneur_affaires_etrangeres.htm), awarded by the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, upon the recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This esteemed recognition, established during the early days of the Third Republic, is conferred upon individuals who have rendered exceptional service to the French cause, acknowledging acts of courage and dedication in service to French citizens abroad.


## Social Media
I do not maintain a presence on social media platforms.
